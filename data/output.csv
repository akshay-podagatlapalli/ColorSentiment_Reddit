The Tulsa race massacre took place on May 31 and June 1 in 1921, when mobs of white residents, some of whom had been appointed as deputies and armed by city officials,[12] attacked Black residents and destroyed homes and businesses of the Greenwood District in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Alternatively known as the Tulsa race riot,[13] the event is considered one of ""the single worst incident[s] of racial violence in American history"" and has been described as one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in the history of the United States.[14][15] The attackers burned and destroyed more than 35 square blocks of the neighborhood – at the time one of the wealthiest Black communities in the United States, colloquially known as ""Black Wall Street.""[16]"

Honestly, people are only talking about this event because Trump launched his 2020 campaign in Tulsa, the plan being on Juneteenth.

There are a lot of other race “massacres” that people still dont pay attention to.

Check into the Elaine Massacre, Atlanta Massacre, East St Louis Riots, Red Summer and Omaha, Detroit Riot of ‘43, to name a few. Those are just the ones widely documented where dozens to hundreds died.

One of the reasons that Tulsa was “forgotten” is that these were semi-regular events.

Unless they have a specific connection that helps the media drive a narrative, nobody will care.

Edit: it was “in search of history: The Night Tulsa Burned”"

When mass violence fell out of favor, local and state governments found other methods to perform ethnic cleansing.

I can’t believe I didn’t learn about this in school.,comment #41,0.6180233955383301,2022-08-27 14:43:28,"I can imagine there are a few reasons (as a history teacher myself):

1. The teachers just legitimately don't know everything. What is taught is often a combination of what they learned through studying, reading, investigation, ready-made curriculum, and what's available in textbooks. There are a lot of great history teachers out there, but there's no way to know about everything and there are A LOT of terribly awful events in history. 

2. No time in the curriculum. Growing up I learned a lot of things about the darker aspects of American history (at an early age too), but there are also things teachers didn't have time for. There are 180 days in a school year and teachers are required to teach standards, content, and skills. That's when the school isn't hosting assemblies or adhering to state standardized testing. A lot of picking and choosing has to be made.

3. District won't allow it as part of the curriculum. (Self-explanatory)

4. The teachers leave things out to aggrandize the United States. Or they're racists.

5. You had sucky teachers. (See #4)

I promise history teachers are trying, but it's hard without good (vetted and widely available) resources and the time to implement it. Additionally, geographic location can have an effect on what we teach as well. Some places will get the Tulsa Massacre as part of the curriculum and others will cover the horrid treatment of Great Plains Native Americans post-Civil War and still others will focus on the racist laws created on the west coast to bar Chinese and Japanese immigrants from getting citizenship. All of it is relevant to the country as a whole, but certain things get more focus because of literal proximity."

I can’t believe I didn’t learn about this in school.,comment #46,0.5261906981468201,2022-08-27 15:10:35,"I took AP U.S. history in high school, and while it was mentioned, I do feel like it wasn't given proper attention, in various texts it was nearly a foot note.  As an adult I asked a similar question nearly a decade ago, I donned my tinfoil hat and started digging, I strapped that hat on tight when I discovered that there was compared to other events in U.S. history a distinct lack of material on the subject.  I didn't know who was trying to memory hole what, but it certainly looked like some successful grand conspiracy.  That Tulsa isn't more prominent in most U.S. history teaching is an utter travesty, there are a lot of good lessons there in.  Unfortunately Tulsa does run counter to various opposing narratives and views of U.S. history and for those who approach history in an effort to paint a pre-conceived narrative rather than trying to view what actually is/was, Tusla tends to be very problematic.  The existence of a thriving ""Black Wall Street"" in a city in the deep south during the Jim Crow era doesn't exactly support various narratives about systemic oppression, however the sudden brutality and lightening fast speed at which is was utterly destroyed certainly does.     


My tin foil hat didn't go on because of a desire to fit the events in a favored view, but because all the surrounding elements point to an intentional effort to hide it.   In the end though I took that hat off, and came to a realization that again it didn't fit neatly into various lenses which are commonly looked through when trying to view U.S. history and make sense of it.  There was a concerted effort to ignore the events, and this was like the ripples created by throwing a stone in a pond.  It wasn't for some nefarious purpose though, and I believe the general blind spot is a result rooted in the community of Tulsa's response in the aftermath.  The events were treated as a proverbial elephant in the room, and while I don't believe there was any formal discussion or agreement, the population of the city seemed to coalesce around  moving on and trying to rebuild rather than dwell and focus on the events, the black community being generally motivated by fear and the white community being generally motivated out of horror and shame.  While an extreme effort to just move on makes little sense toward a goal of progress that we see later in the civil rights era, it makes a perfect sense for the average Tulsa citizen who just wanted to live a normal peaceful life.  Had the Tulsa massacre occurred merely a few decades later the story and prominence in history would likely have been radically different."

There’s a giant pile of things between kindergarten and senior year of high school that students now are supposed to learn. This giant pile of things is called the common core state standards that differ slightly state to state. Some people would argue they differ greatly state to state. The skill of your teacher is another variable to consider as well as your personal profile and home life. With that giant pile of things the variables of your teacher yourself in your home typically will decrease how many of those things that you actually learn.

What we are supposed to learn or what students should learn is an excellent debate. The common course state standards are usually decided at the state level differentiated from the federal level. These are decided by politicians with varying degrees of universities and teachers and put again different state to state.

If You went to school before 2010 you did not have a common core state standards in your state or even your school could differ in a huge range of what you actually learned.

Well common core state standards get a lot of criticism it is a platform where things like this could be integrated into. Common complaints about education are why didn’t we learn this or why aren’t we taught personal finances, why aren’t we taught how to change oil on our cars, why don’t we get taught about cooking or how birth control works? Why do we have to learn quadratic formulas? Teachers myself included most likely would love to teach those things or perhaps more influential moments in history such as the Tulsa massacre however we have an obligation to taxpayers to fulfill our duty to teach the common core state standards of our given state. There is absolutely not enough time to get that done each year unless you are a phenomenally functional school with a mythical student body.

I would argue a taxpayer-citizen such as yourself should look to see, or ask a teacher is the Tulsa massacre reflected in the CCSS of our state? If not I would explore adding a ballot measure or pressuring your local official officials to make that change. Additionally something like a massacre might not be appropriate to the second grade level however I can’t imagine a good reason why I can’t be taught by the time someone is 18, that would be ironed out later in the legislative process about when it would be taught. Again, a lot of people criticize: “why wasn’t I thought this in school” we were all taught totally different things in school before 2010.

I voice typed all of this I’m not editing it I have to go get my classroom set up for the school year, enjoy wonderful students who change make my day, and receive substandard pay.

Why Is the United States Hostile to Socialism?,comment #2,0.4494236707687378,2023-11-01 08:45:25,"I think there was a period during the late 20s/30s where there was quite a few revolutions going on throughout the sphere due to numerous economic crisis's. Many nations 

The theory goes that during the great depression, many started to think that maybe capitalism has failed and that a new system was needed. However, many in government, and mainly FDR realized they had to do something to give this a soft landing to the situation to avoid greater shifts to more radicalized parties and ideas. You had the lassiez faire right who wanted to take absolutely no action, and then FDR who said government can fix this problem through borrowing and shifting of funds around to focus on New Deal spending, works programs, etc. In essence, they felt that he then gave America the soft-landing it needed to continue with capitalism and without the radicalization of the population towards a fascists or socialist ideology as was going on in Europe. 

I'm sure I'm glossing over lots of details, but I suspect that during this period, socialism was heavenly demonized. After WW2, you then had the two ideologies face off directly with the US vs USSR in a cold war which shifted the US thinking even further away from anything even tangently named socialism.

Anyways, that's kind of my summary of how people came to their current views in US."

There is a very large percentage of the population who sees government as more of a hindrance than a help. 

This is a consequence of our unique history.   Remember, immigration to this colony/country was often driven by overbearing government policies even going back 400 years, or the desire to be ""free"", however they defined that.   

Combine that with people extending the boundaries of the country into places with little or no government for at least half of our history, and you can see why a significant portion, if not a majority, would reject a system where government has even more control over our lives."

Conversely, nobody ever cites escaping capitalism as a reason for immigrating. People are only ever running towards it.

Also, it’s not hard to just look at history. The socialist countries pretty much always fail or are stuck in economic misery with low ceilings for their citizens’ quality of life. The most powerful, successful and free opportunity states are capitalist states. 

This is of course broadly speaking. Obviously there’s a bit of socialism even in this country such as social security, etc.. People dont hate socialism to the extent where no such policies are acceptable. They hate it when socialism takes the forefront of a government’s policies and runs rampant. I expect you’re more so asking why people hate that sort of total state socialism rather than specific policies."

But what I usually draw attention to is how the United States is one of the few countries that was truly *born* into capitalism. Founded by proto-national bourgeois for proto-national bourgeois with the question of an agrarian or industrial based economy being decided in favor of the latter in the Civil War.

Most good answers to the socialism question are best answered starting from the civil war imo. You have the dual points of the victory of Industrial capitalism along with the death of early American labor movements on the battlefield (entire unions would volunteer to fight for the Union armies together and so many early organizers and activists died on Civil War battlefields while the future titans of the Gilded Age had bought the right to stay home)"

Starting in the post-Civil War reconstruction, she draws a line from rich southern (pro-slavery) Democrats who thought using government funds (paid by taxes) to help poor (black) people was income redistribution from those who earned it to those who didn’t. She then ties that theme through the American West and the myth of the (white) American cowboy, who allegedly didn’t need anyone’s help to survive off the land and prosper (this was largely propaganda), which builds throughout the 1900s and culminates in the election of Ronald Reagan.

We all know people who have started with very little and done very well in life. IMO, it is much harder to change status in more socialist societies. You can have a nice, middle-class life but if you go to open a business and hire people, you may have to pay crippling taxes or offer unaffordable benefits for your employees. You see a lot of family or sole-proprietor businesses in these societies as they don't come under the tax and benefit umbrella, but larger entrepreneurial enterprises are difficult to build if you don't already have vast amounts of wealth.

Because of the feeling that we can change our position in life, we identify more with the rich and want to see their businesses thrive and their property rights protected because we see our potential selves in them. We identify less with the labor organizer trying to mandate wealth redistribution. Most people would probably be better off in a European-style socialist-leaning society than they are in America, but hope springs eternal in us all."

Why Is the United States Hostile to Socialism?,comment #62,0.460457980632782,2023-11-01 22:34:47,"This is my opening post and after reading the article \*GASP\*, I am going to summarize each of the 4 authors and give my opinion of their explanation.   
  
**Adam Smith**

  
My take is that Smith is suggesting that the question should be what in the social, political, economic and racial environment encouraged the rise of socialism like British Labour Party or the German SPD but didn’t in America. 

  
I think boils down the demographics of the people. I have a sense that Germany and Britain appear to have been fairly homogeneous when it comes ethnicity. This makes tailoring a message to communicate your ideas is far simpler when “everybody” (or a lot of bodies) has similar motivations and drivers. Finding the “magic bullet” of a message is a lot easier there than in America. 

  
The United States was far different in that the racial/ethic demography was very diversified so finding a message AND a messenger that would resonate across a widely diverse population would be a significant challenge. This enabled the body politic to have a quasi-immunity to new revolutionary ideals.   

  
Now this immunity was not perfect and we see some socialist seeds take root (like the unions in the coal mines and garment trade which were dominated by a single racial/ethnic group).

  
So, in this way Sombart was right that the ethnic divisions (I would call it diversity) built a shield against socialist thought and revolution.   
  
**Susan-Mary Grant** 

  
IMO, her take is that the objection to socialism is driven by a ignorance. Solving for that ignorance is why the polls that she quotes show the socialism is gaining traction on the positive perception side of the ledger.   
She continues to looks to solve for the problem Smith/Sombart faced: make the “face” of America more homogeneous and she presents 1) the US Military as evidence that can be done and 2) in situations of extreme economic stress.    
She may be correct on the military. My interactions with soldiers is limited (I never served) but I do know there can be some racial and ethnic tensions amongst the rank and file “in family” but to the outsider tries to mimic? This diverse group of men and women swiftly merge and become a cohesive force of all green (or blue or whatever color your service uses). When they are in this mode, they are susceptible to the magic bullet of a message.    
  
**Zachary Jonathan Jacobson**

  
While the words are different, he, via Irving Howe, points to the immunizing force that diversity brings to the table. Finding a single hot button (or a small number of hot buttons) that range the bell across the working class is damningly difficult to pull off.   
  
**Vincent Bevins**

  
He, IMO, has the weakest answer. The American culture, from its formation to the early 20th century had no real triggers that sparked the socialist/communist revolutions.   
IMO, the closest, I guess, that we did come to a critical mass was during the Gilded Age where the wealth gap widened, workers were boxed in, tied to their employers and had not realized their power. Before they truly understood (or were blatantly shown) their power, Teddie Roosevelt was able to corral the enough people for the government to do (or at least appear to be doing) something.  This essentially defused the smoldering powder kegs.   


&#x200B;

Overall, the melting pot that made up this country as well as ability to forge unified fronts when threatened and the timely intervention of government (with visible and tangible outcomes) basically created an environment inimical to the seeds and growth of socialism.

Social Security is socialism. Public education is socialism. The Veterans' Administration, Medicare, Medicaid, public highways, public utilities... all of that is socialism.  Where we've failed is in carving out all these programs to benefit only specific groups or classes of people, so that builds in an out-group who at best doesn't care about the health of the program but at worst actively campaigns against it. 

Like anyone wanting to means-test Social Security for only non-wealthy people doesn't understand that all that will do is buy a couple more years of Social Security longevity and put an entire class of people -- the rich and powerful -- directly in opposition to the program.  

Same with Medicare being only for the elderly, or Medicaid only for the poor. If these programs were just combined and expanded and available to everyone, the entire country would be on the same page about wanting them to be better."

The Republican Party has popularly redefined socialism as taxation and redistribution of nearly any kind, rather than the dictionary definition of socialism as public ownership of production. It's a slippery slope argument. 

Politics are now defined by television, which is very effective at redefining language through repetition. Television time is extremely costly, so our language belongs to those who can afford more television time--or those who can afford to create giant political television networks of their own. And television's specialty is creating tribal identity, whether that's feelings for the cast of *Friends* or feeling like a besieged white American. 

The Cold War is now ancient history, let alone the 1930s New Deal or the 1890s Progressive Era. The largest political television networks now define basic social programs as socialism, and they strive to portray them as *someone else's* socialism.

Why Is the United States Hostile to Socialism?,comment #85,0.4716203808784485,2023-11-15 02:39:29,"In the 19th to 20th century Europe, due to the higher population density and limited land and other natural resources, the working class were exploited particularly cruelly by the capitalists. The workers found that even if they worked hard all year round, their family would still not having enough food and clothing. So socialism, as a radical and violent reform theory of the social system, is supported by many people, especially the working class and the urban intellectuals.

But in the new world, for a long time the North American population of European colonists was far smaller than its natural resources could support. Therefore, it was difficult for the capitalists to exploit the working class too much as they did in Europe. If the workers' wages were too low, then the workers would leave the factory and go to the west to open up new farms. Also, the cheaper natural resources price in the new world made American enterprises more competive than their European counterparts. Therefore the wages and purchasing power of the American workers are much higher than the European workers of the same era.

This is why the American capitalists was able to suppress the communists easily during the rise of the communism movements in Europe in the 19th century. Only in the 20th century, when the resource dividends of the New World were offset by the growing population, and the easily reclaimable wasteland in the American West was occupied by capitalists, did the labor movement in the United States gradually rise."

Many have families that consist of blue collar workers and also having members that own businesses or even farms. Point being there isn’t really economic classes that are completely disconnected from each other as say in 19th century Europe so the even the thought of Uniting the “working class” against the land owners doesn’t really hit home with the intended audience being the workers who many of then one you leave large urban area own homes and property themselves.

I really do think they go together very well, because ""Capitalism"" doesn't mean ""Unregulated markets"" in fact, I would say that an ""Unregulated Market"" isn't a ""Free Market"" at all, but little more than a contest to see who can commit the most fraud.

In fact, I think there are some really strong Capitalist arguments for Socialism because educated people have more skills, and frankly, any capitalist that thinks he is at a disadvantage by having a larger pool of skills to draw from is, frankly, kind of an idiot.

Society being socialist is a benefit to a good capitalist. Socialism is about people and should handle the development and care of people. Capitalism is great for distribution or resources and pushing progress forward. Its a beautiful marriage.

I think the big issue really is that the anti-socialist people have some great arguments when you point at how disastrously bad our regulations and social programs are. If this is socialism, then take it out to the wood shed and shoot it because it failed.

Agree

>The New Deal wasn’t used to save capitalism and prevent socialism, it was socialism. 

Hard disagree.  Keynesian economics (new deal) is no more socialist than Norway or finland is socialist.  Both countries do not consider themselves to be socialist.  They are social democracies.  Meaning they are still capitalist and liberal democracies, with high taxes and social welfare, and some baseline of worker owned co ops/workplaces.  They are still very capitalist.

Keynesian economics was 100% used to save the economy, as unregulated capitalism will implode upon itself as it has showed us time and time again.  The threat of communism and the socialist uprising in the early 20th century was a threat to capitalism.  THus forcing social democrats to adopt more socialist-lite polices into their economies.

The new deal era was not socialist, but used keynesian economics and a mixed economy to stabilize the depression, otherwise there would have been a full scale socialist revolution in america. WWII is what created an economic boom.  Not the new deal.

>And Capitalists ripped it apart in the 30 years that followed and have done everything in their power to stop anything like the New Deal from ever happening again.

Agreed

Neo liberalism was adapted, IE global markets and outsourcing because capitalism had fully ""over ripened"" in the states. There will never be anything remotely close to Keynesian economics in the us ever again.  we no longer have the threat of communism that we hade in the early and mid twentieth century"

Pretty much zero without significant amount of effort being put into developing them.  The first few settlements had a \*REALLY\* tough time of it.   Privation was the order of the day. 

Even after the East Coast had become significantly developed in the 18th Century, almost no one who emigrated to the colonies hit the big time.  A very large number came over as either [prisoners](https://www.thehistorypress.co.uk/articles/the-land-of-the-free-criminal-transportation-to-america/) (so not by choice) or as [indentured servants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentured_servitude_in_British_America) and thus weren't going to be exploiting imagined riches.  

 Really the only actual resource available to a new immigrant was land, and it was land far removed from the population centers at that.   That put them into conflict with the people already living on that land (Native Americans), and it largely limited them to manual subsistence farming with a limited amount of cash crops they could exchange for a limited amount of goods.   This is why whiskey became a significant medium of exchange:  It was easier to haul 10 barrels of whiskey a few dozen miles to town than the nearly 3 tons of corn it took to make it.  

It was a very hardscrabble existence.   

Even the romanticism attached to jobs like the longhunter are unwarranted, as that job meant you were away from family for months to a year at a time, and the hides you collected and processed for sale could be stolen by Natives, or destroyed by the elements, and if you were injured there was no available treatment, and often no one to help you at all."

Socialism is a vague term that encompasses a wide variety of concepts and ideologies, Marxism-Leninism (or ""Communism"") is only one form (and I would argue a rather extreme form) of it. Most people would agree that Sweden and France have a history of socialist-leaning governments, and I don't think anyone would seriously call them ""abysmal failures""."

Honestly most economic systems are neither better nor worse than the others, because they all have the same glaring flaw: human nature.  Yeah, in an unregulated socialist system it is possible for one party monopolize power, and create a state where the party controls all resources rather than the people.  But in an unregulated capitalist system, the exact same thing happens and it’s just a small group of corporate aristocrats who seize all the resources and power, rather than a political party.

In either system, the key is having checks upon our innate greed and desire to dominate each other.  Capitalism is great, if you can stop the small group of wealthiest people from exploiting the system to destroy anyone else’s capacity for social mobility.  And socialism is also great, if you can stop the ruling party from becoming filled with sycophants and careerists as opposed to genuine public servants.

The problem isn’t in the ideology of either system, it’s in the way we allow a small number of people to exploit whatever system is in place at the expense of the rest of us."

But no you’re wrong on two accounts

A) that this is a good answer

B) that my response was pedantic

Because I know *quite a bit* about this topic and recognized the answer as overly simplistic and doesn’t actually answer the question and that it stemmed from the posters (and clearly yours) lack of understanding of socialism

Socialism is *not* when the government does stuff which is what this person more or less said and used as the basis for their (incorrect) answer

In fact the Western United States frontier is where many socialist movements were *strongest.* The IWW and other radical unions like the United Mine Workers were very active in “frontier” states like Colorado or California

The reason the socialist movement in the United States struggled was due to the lack of worker organizing and class consciousness. Westward expansion was a pressure valve release on the societal pressures that *lead* to class consciousness and worker organization but that world was over by the 1880’s/1890’s and there’s still decades worth of socialist organizing that hasn’t happened yet, let alone the first and second red scares

So no the downvotes on my comment and your response are ironic considering I’m *literally* a labor historian and rather than picking apart the mistakes that stemmed from the incorrect definition of socialism I instead went for the source to point out he was misdefining socialism and that was ultimately why the answer was wrong which would be a far easier conversation to have rather than going through the mistake point by point"

The other poster missed a bit with their exact definitions. The ""stateless, moneyless classless society"" is technically a definition for communism, but it means fuckall to most people.

The actual way Marx described these ideologies was that under capitalism the means of production are owned privately by capitalists. In socialism they are owned by the labourers working the job. In communism they are owned collectively by the entire community.

Everyone knows the very famous Marx quote about communism, ""from each according to their ability, to each according to their need"", but fewer people have heard the socialist version of this quote ""from each according to their ability, to each according to their work"".

If you know your economic history, prior to WWII the world almost exclusively used the gold standard.  Balances of trade were always an issue (even in supposed ""laissez faire"" countries like England, which only pretended to be laissez faire because it had a colonial system to dump goods and keep its factories competitive).  Gold flowing in meant banks were healthy, which meant more loans, which means business booms.  Gold flowing out could crash a banking system.

Business then always had interest in the success of nation states.  Capitalists like to act as if businesses are one entity, states are another entity, and they act independently, have independent interests, and states are just bad for these businesses.

But any real historical analysis shows that's obviously untrue, and it was very untrue leading up to WWII.  WWII happened in no small part due to clashing commercial interests and nation states, and these policies helped destroy the world economy. 
 Even worse, *poor* people were getting politically active (scary thought!!!!!).  The populism led to things like the Soviet Union and to fascism, so economic thinkers were very concerned with making sure it doesn't happen again.

That's why Bretton Woods was actually signed, it was to create a lasting and robust system that wouldn't be prone to the failures that caused WWII.  It did so by, largely, sticking it to the rich and making the lives of the poor better.  Things like capital controls, along with higher taxes rates, forced the wealthy to redistribute alot of their down to poorer folks instead of destabilizing the world.  And it worked, which is why the 1950s-70s saw a massive increase in wealth for poorer people in Japan and the West.

The New Deal is related to all of this, its just the American domestic version (Bretton Woods was largely the brain child of Keynes).  It still accepts the fundamental reality that to avoid populism, poor people can't be treated like shit and you have to rein in wealthy people sometimes.

It's too bad the west has forgotten all of that and seems on track for a revival of populism.

So the New Deal is basically a pro-capitalist policy, but it was a set of policies that basically conceded wealthy to poor people so they won't burn down the entire fucking system.  Whether you call that socialism is really a meaningless token, it's better to just understand what it's aims were."

Social democracy was an attempt to address capitalisms shortcomings with growing inequality and an erosion in the average persons quality of life. Normally they wouldn’t have cared, but with the threat of communism it became standard well into the 1970s as a compromise. 

The key difference between social democracy and democratic socialism is the abolition of capitalism. Social democracy exists in a capitalist society whereas democratic socialism works to abolish capitalism and transfer ownership of production to the working class through democratic means"

The US was already industrializing and developing at a faster rate than any other country at the time; the fact that they were then fed money and resources to produce even more for their allies during the war (because Britain and the like were under constant threat of bombing raids and had their industry targeted by the luftwaffe) and on top of this were pretty much the only major industrial power to *not* get bombed or invaded, left them with a glorious leg up on the entire rest of the world.  Add to that mix unmatched levels of arable land, material science and other technological innovations due to the war (and the hiring of many prominent German and Jewish scientists both before and after the war) and its rather unsurprising that one of two superpowers to emerge— and the only one to emerge with their entire agriculture and industry intact— ended up having a stronger economy post war than in the Depression leading up to the war.

No, socialist countries do not continue private operation. In a socialist society workers control the means of production. Scandinavian states are not socialist. They are capitalist, social democracies.

The issue here is there is an academic definition and a colloquial definition (capital S vs not). They are similar, but when Americans talk about socialism, they’re referring to lower case s, not a full system of government. When Americans who advocate for socialism, they are advocating for more socialist services, but the people who are against it hate the word socialism and anyone in America who uses it despite the differing definitions. I could be wrong, but I assume when OP promoted as to why Americans hate socialism, they mean the American colloquial understanding (or arguably lack thereof) of socialism because much of this country thinks if we have single payer healthcare we’ve become Socialism (capital) and that half the countries in Europe operate under Socialism (and yet none actually do).

My belief as to the reason for this misunderstanding is because of corporate hijacking of the word and fear mongering for any version of socialist services implying that any implementing any more socialist services is a slippery slope to actual Socialism (which is impossible without starting completely over)."

Capitalism and socialism aren’t mutually exclusive - you can have parts of both at the same time. Socialism is the pooling of money and resources and redistributing them for the general good. Communism is when the government controls both the distribution and means of production - everything is state owned. Socialism is very far from communism where its goal is to establish a minimum baseline of wealth for all citizens to improve the average well being and welfare of its citizens, unlike communism where the government decides how much its workers are worth and owns everything the workers do. Most countries operating under strong aspects of socialism have capitalism still functioning as the primary system. Now we could get into a debate about socialism with a capital S, but seeing as how that has never been actualized, it makes make sense to discuss in this context."

In practice we use communism and socialism differently for the exact reason to separate the two systems since the systems have been implemented differently. Taxes are not just socialism but the decision of what to do with them can be. Perhaps a better way to explain this is to use the term socialist instead. A socialist (in practice)  is someone who wants to do what I wrote in the other comment and redistribute a baseline of wealth for the greater good. Most socialists, and 99% of people who refer to socialism in the context of the US mean only, with a few exceptions (education, military, emergency services). Even those are arguable because you’re not actually producing anything but serving. These a lot more nuance to this conversation than people give credit for and I think  part of the problem in the US is people talking apples and oranges when it comes to this topic. Exactly like we are doing now. You are using the academic definition as proposed by philosophers. But in practice it’s never implemented that way purely and has only ever been implemented under the term Socialism as a partial economic policy, not as a system of governance (again except under communism, which is removed from this conversation).

The prompt from OP is referring to this latter understanding. No one in the US is talking about Socialism with a capital S when they say they want more of it. Not Bernie, not any democratic socialists, not far leftists except for a crazy few .1% who want actual communism. They just want better socialist services to establish a baseline systemic welfare so people don’t have to worry about inelastic goods and services during hard times (this is where capitalism fails entirely). In other words socialism (not capitalized) has replaced or at best confusingly added to the definition of the word. And again it’s this definition to which people refer when they speak about it, and when in conversation the intent must be taken into account just like any other word to have a rational conversation.

You can’t have more Socialism with a capital S, you either are it or you are not. But plain old socialism as a bad word in this country is never referring to that. Nobody wants that."

1. The United States is “hostile to socialism” because of the first and second red scares and decades worth of propaganda. But this only applies to the 20th Century and were *reactions* to moments of major popularity of socialist movements be it groups like the IWW in the First red scare or CPUSA in the second red scare

2. You’re putting the cart before the horse and practicing bad history. The crackdowns of the second red scare were because of communism’s growing popularity, the same reason of the first red scare. Both were parts of larger overall systems of reaction to explosive growth in leftist political power after the Russian Revolution in reference to first red scare and the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War in the case of the second. These reactions were not limited to the United States and not indicative of any particular *American* hostility to socialism. Your analysis also fundamentally doesn’t grasp with the concept of cultural hegemony which is what your statements about the insanity of America cracking down on capitalists (which wouldn’t make sense in a society where the capitalists are the ones in power)

3. Well considering that communism and socialism are in fact two different things yes I would point out that they’re two different things. How are you even trying to use those words in this context?

4. No almost everything in this statement is either wrong or misrepresentation of reality to such an extent it may as well be wrong. We can start with the fundamental principle of westward expansion being into “unsettled land,” which is not true. It was settled and in fact the United States government had to fight a massive war just to pacify the people who in fact lived there so that they can continue to push people West in efforts to relieve societal pressures. But this ended in the 1880’s/1890’s like I said, and you don’t have to take my word for it, it’s literally what people at the time said. But claiming that this is why America “doesn’t support socialism,” is bad analysis and bad history. As I’ve said elsewhere this “western frontier” was actually at the forefront of leftist political movements in the country be it overtly socialist ones such as the IWW or non-socialist left wing populism like the Populist Party. Major political radicals of the time such as Big Bill Haywood rose to prominence in these very frontier environments you have claimed prevented the rise of socialism, I would love to see you make an argument that Bill Haywood was not a socialist. 

What you haven’t grasped is what socialism is and what it requires. Socialism, the social ownership of the means of production by the workers who work upon it, requires worker organization and worker organization requires class consciousness. A simple reading of US labor history indicates what led to the lack of a major socialist working class movement- the constant murder and arrest of all successful organizers be it Bill Haywood, Eugene Debs, Albert Parsons, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Sacco and Vanzetti, Emma Goldman, etc"

Why Is the United States Hostile to Socialism?,comment #288,0.761814534664154,2023-11-01 17:48:38,"You’re wrong. 

Private ownership is inherently freedom. It’s the ability of individuals to own property and profits. The opposite is no freedom where individuals would not own property or profits. Is it more free for you to own your own home and business or more free for the government to own your home and business?

What you describe as an economy which solely enriches a dictator is not capitalism. That’s more akin to feudalism. Individuals are not allowed to own their own property or profits. 

For example, Cuba is a communist country. It’s absolutely not capitalist. And yet, it solely enriched the Castro family. The key is the rights of the subjects of the government and what they are allowed to do. By your logic, everything under the sun is capitalist because no matter what system you have, someone gets enriched. 

If you disagree with this then we must agree to disagree."

It’s just confusing because the Soviets also “created” communism because their rise created a split in Socialist groups on how to actually achieve socialism. It’s why Communist parties didn’t exist until about 1919. Everyone who followed Lenin and the Soviet Union became Communist, and everyone else stayed Socialist."

If Workers own the Means of Production in common, you primarily eliminate the class divide. Welfare is compatible with Socialism, but is not the primary goal. The primary goal is for Workers to own the full value of their own labor, so that society in general is more free. The workers would likely decide to provide more, such as guaranteeing Healthcare, Housing, and Education, but that's an end result, not the system itself.

The Roman Empire's Worst Plagues Were Linked to Climate Change,comment #1,0.4683806300163269,2024-01-31 16:01:59,"Similar theories have been applied to the black plague and the epidemics of the little ice age, where a bad harvest will lead to starvation/malnutrition and leave the population vulnerable to disease. Meaning more aggressive R values\* for a wider and more aggressive spread on top of more people dying (as illness is stacked on top of malnutrition).

&#x200B;

\*Basic reproductive numbers. R values are the chance of a disease spreading from one host to the next. R values lower than 1 means the disease will eventually die out as fewer and fewer people are infected. R values above 1 means it will spread further as each infected will spread the disease to more than one person during the infections progress. ""R0""/""R Zero"" is the value at the outbreak of the disease while R1, R2 etc is as time progresses and things like population density and immunity values change."
The Roman Empire's Worst Plagues Were Linked to Climate Change,comment #2,0.43938788771629333,2024-01-31 16:35:59,"I think we have to be careful with headings like this due to the natural reaction we have these days to associate ""climate change"" with the human caused climate change of today.

With the issue of climate change being such a hot button political issue today I think it's more important than ever to talk about the natural climate cycles of Earth (known as Milankovitch Cycles) and what roles they've played. 

But what is being talked about here specifically isn't about any ""meaningful"" climate change (ha! Go ahead and tell that to the people who died in the plague of Justinian), but what I mean by that is that there are regular climate disruptions, often related to (typically) volcanic activity.

I actually used volcanic activity over the last 2,000 years as an example for a recent podcast episode I did explaining how climate science works and how we know we can trust it. There is a lot of climate denier misinformation that acts like wild climate swings happen so regularly that what's going on now is nothing. They will reference small scale climate examples like the Roman Warm Period and the Little Ice Age as if these were meaningful climate shifts. These periods were actually far more localized than previously thought.

Volcanic activity has temporarily destabilized climate for several years at a time. The famed ""year without a summer"" in 1816 led to crop failures and even played a role in the 1819 financial panic and pandemics in Asia was due to the Tambora eruption. In the 13th century the Samalas eruption also led to crop failures and diseases and gave rise to the Flagellants for the first time, they came back again when the Black Death arrived (which was not climate related).

And while I haven't fully looked into *this article* there are tantalizing clues that a volcanic eruption may be the precursor to the Plague of Justinian as well. If you want to listen to the podcast I did on all of this you can find it below (along with the sources I used and I encourage everyone to check them out):

The Roman Empire's Worst Plagues Were Linked to Climate Change,comment #11,0.4373752176761627,2024-02-05 12:23:06,"I have not heard this theory and if this is true I'd love to see any sources you have to provide. Without dates or any specifics I find this theory hard to believe for a few reasons:
* First, whatever was going on in the Amazon rainforest would've had to have been *huge* to impact global weather patterns. While pre Colombian Native American numbers are hard to know for certain by all accounts it was far less than what was going on in the old world, especially Asia. So what could indigenous Americans do that would impact climate so substantially that wasn't happening anywhere in the Old World?
* Also, you have to consider wind patterns as well. So for example in the North Atlantic winds travel West to East, but once you get to the mid Atlantic winds do from East to West meaning that anything happening in the Amazon would be blowing towards Asia, rather than Europe. There is actually a powerful impact the Sahara Desert has on the Amazon climate *due* to these wind patterns, but for the impact to work in the other direction would mean that whatever was happening in the Amazon was even that much more intense.
* Then we have to look at what climate evidence we DO have in ice cores. Through all of my research nothing indicates anthropomorphic climate change prior to the 19th century.
* Finally, what archeological evidence in the Amazon is there that something that could impact global climate was happening there? I haven't heard of anything like that. 

I appreciate you asking a question if you thought you've heard of something like that but I'd have to ask you for credible evidence to back that up because there are so many factors working against such an idea that I have to think it's highly unlikely to have been the case. But I'd be happy to learn something new if true."

The ark is primarily a Jewish artifact, adopted as significant by Christianity like many Jewish traditions due to Christianity 's origins.

I don't think a great deal of this, it's too political, in many of the wars it mentions there is a clear military victory but the article casts it as a loss because, politically, it wasn't massively beneficial.

The Philippines War was a failure because, even though we annexed them, we ""completely disgraced every ideal America has ever claimed"". I won't dispute the validity of that claim (or other similar claims), but I'm not sure what it has to do with whether or not America achieved tactical victory.

This article appears to be framed as a counting of war victories and losses, as opposed to moral rectitude, which -while both part of an informed debate about the necessity of a particular engagement - represent two fundamentally different ways of analyzing events. 

For example, I tend to disagree that the Korean War was anything better than a draw: North Korea remained a stable(ish) government, Communism continued to spread through East Asia, and 15 years later we were back in Vietnam essentially fighting the same fight. Perhaps if America had followed through on MacArthur's plan to nuke the Koreas and succeeded in ousting the Communists, the author would be able to categorize it as a defeat, since we would have used questionable means.

A better title and tone might have been ""Review of American misconduct in successful and unsuccessful campaigns"". That article could potentially be insightful and instructive.

For example, he completely misrepresents the first Gulf War. Saddam invaded and annexed a nearby country. This is a huge ""no-no"" in terms of international relations. Other countries start to feel they could be the next target, and so they increase military spending and make alliances. This promotes further tension and destabilization, and increases the chances of a general, region-wide war occurring.

As such, Saddam had to be slapped down immediately, both to free the Kuwatis and to send a message that such behaviour would not be tolerated in the future.

Likewise there was a clear purpose behind the Afghanistan campaign. The Taliban harboured and protected a terrorist group that had attacked the US. In order to destroy an Al-Qaeda safe haven (which included training camps and supply networks), and invasion was necessary. Staying to build a stable government is a silly thing to do, but the military response was justified and successful.

de Gaulle wrote a book called ""Le Guerre du Future"" (sp?), or ""The Army of the Future"", which outlined the methods that were later used by the Nazis.  He outlined methods of using tanks and trucks to move an army extremely quickly, and how they allowed for an army to pass through the Black Forest by way of Poland faster than the French defenses (effectively predicting the future almost exactly).  The French generals not only failed to heed these warnings, but continued to use old maps which said that the northern route was impassable by armies, in spite of the fact that by the start of WW2, there were several highways built by the Polish and French themselves to cross the border there.  Basically, his warnings fell on deaf ears, except for a German general (Guberland or something?)  who read it and rewrote it in his own words under the name ""Achtung Panzer"".

""I am not a historian""

As for the rest of my post, I was kind of joking.  Here's what I understand of how he gets so much credit, but it's possible I missed the mark: 

De Gaulle probably wasn't so great a General in the same sense as Napolean, but he was just as important as a military leader.  He propped up a government in exile, and organized the resistance by way of radio during the occupation.  In terms of Hollywood heroes, I think the closest would be John Conner in Terminator (That new one in sepia).  He created the resistance by telling the people listening that they were the resistance, and then managed to head-butt his way into the Allied Forces shin-digs.  Without him, France probably would have just been seen as a big battlefield to the Allies, rather than a nation to help free. While the allies would likely have been able to gain a foothold and eventually win the war in a similar fashion, without him I am pretty sure that a LOT of allied soldiers would have died without help from the French, just in the first few months after D-Day. 

I don't think the game he was playing in WW2 has been played before or since, and he played like a grandmaster."

This is what I teach my students, in addition to the historical context mentioned in the article. It is amazing the misconceptions some people have. We also discuss harvest festivals from around the world and at least try to discuss the nuance involved in where the holiday originated versus how we celebrate it now.

One interesting thing I have noticed is that some teachers are damaging the history of Thanksgiving by perhaps pushing back too far with inaccurate information. For example, teaching things like Thanksgiving never happened or that Ousamequin was forced against his will into a treaty. While the latter has some truth since, as mentioned, there was a reason he sought a treaty, I feel (as a non-native, admittedly) it takes away from his agency and again makes the story about colonists. Furthermore, I've also met teachers who mix up the Wampanoag tribes with the tribes the Wampanoag were at war with, and claim that all of them were killed by the Pilgrims. With all of this in mind, I think one thing is clear: Thanksgiving does need to be revisited by public education.

Thanks for the resources. I'd be happy to review them before teaching this lesson again."

You’re correct that it is one of the few times that they actually got along, but referring to it as simply a get-together and highlighting it in that way removes all the context from what was going on. I feel it’s at best reductive, and at worst a distortion of history, to celebrate it as anything other than a celebration of a working relationship that would doom an entire set of cultures. 

It’s a great ‘what-if’ of history but it’s just a dream, and I don’t feel it does a service to the descendants of either side. It allows one to live in a fantasy, and forces the other to be reduced to a passive footnote in their own history.

Declarations of ""days of Thanksgiving"" had been made since the Continental Congress, usually to be observed in late November. While not uniformly observed annually (Jefferson as the obvious example of not declaring one), they were periodically declared in most states, if not the federal government.

Yes, Lincoln declared one in 1863. Yes, that started the more annual tradition. However, it wasn't codified as an actual ""national observance"" until 1870, when Grant signed the ""Holidays Act"" into law... and even then, the date as to which it was to be observed was left at the discretion of the President. Subsequent administrations stuck with the last Thursday of November, as Lincoln had, until FDR set it to the fourth Thursday of the November, in an effort to boost sales for Christmas during the Great Depression.

Now, as for your accusations of the OPs political bias, I would wonder what exactly you have as an issue with them presenting discussion based on Indigenous people's experience with European settlers."

Knowing the context of a holiday is important, both from a historical and anthropological perspective, but I feel it's fairly easy for posts like this to really miss the mark; less focused on historicity or context, and more on trying to shame people for celebrating holidays they dislike.

Reframing the Thanksgiving Narrative,comment #25,0.4206154942512512,2023-11-11 16:53:01,"Hi!   
  
It seems like you are talking about the popular but ultimately flawed and false ""winners write history"" trope!  
  
While the expression is sometimes true in one sense (we'll get to that in a bit), it is rarely if ever an absolute truth, and particularly not in the way that the concept has found itself commonly expressed in popular history discourse. When discussing history, and why some events have found their way into the history books when others have not, simply dismissing those events as the imposed narrative of 'victors' actually harms our ability to understand history.  
  
You could say that is in fact a somewhat ""lazy"" way to introduce the concept of bias which this is ultimately about. Because whoever writes history is the one introducing their biases to history.  
  
A somewhat better, but absolutely not perfect, approach that works better than 'winners writing history' is to say '*writers* write history'.  
  
This is more useful than it initially seems. Until fairly recently the literate were a minority, and those with enough literary training to actually write historical narratives formed an even smaller and more distinct class within that.  
  
To give a few examples, Genghis Khan must surely go down as one of the great victors in all history, but he is generally viewed quite unfavorably in practically all sources, because his conquests tended to harm the literary classes.  
Similarly the Norsemen historically have been portrayed as uncivilized barbarians as the people that wrote about them were the ""losers"" whose monasteries got burned down. 
  
Of course, writers are a diverse set, and so this is far from a magical solution to solving the problems of bias. The painful truth is, each source simply needs to be evaluated on its own merits.  
This evaluation is something that is done by historians and part of what makes history and why insights about historical events can shift over time. 
  
This is possibly best exemplified by those examples where victors *did* unambiguously write the historical sources.  
  
The Spanish absolutely wrote the history of the conquest of Central America from 1532, and the reports and diaries of various conquistadores and priests are still important primary documents for researchers of the period.  
  
But 'victors write the history' presupposes that we still use those histories as they intended, which is simply not the case. It both overlooks the fundamental nature of modern historical methodology, and ignores the fact that, while victors have often proven to be predominant voices, they have rarely proven to be the only voices.  
  
Archaeology, numismatics, works in translation, and other records all allow us at least some insight into the 'losers' viewpoint, as does careful analysis of the 'winner's' records.  
We know far more about Rome than we do about Phoenician Carthage. There is still vital research into Carthage, as its being a daily topic of conversation on this subreddit testifies to.
  
So while it's true that the balance between the voices can be disparate that doesn't mean that the winners are the only voice or even the most interesting.  
Which is why stating that history is 'written by the victors' and leaving it at that is harmful to the understanding of history and the process of studying history.
